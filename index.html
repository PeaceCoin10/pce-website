      <h2>About PCE</h2>
      <p>The ultimate goal of the PCE project is to become the core pillar of the global anti-war and peace movement, closely integrating anti-war actions with economic incentives through the power of cryptocurrency. Our specific objectives are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Promote Global Anti-War Actions:</strong> Through the widespread circulation of PCE tokens, we aim to raise global awareness about the need for peace. With a decentralized blockchain system, every token holder can become part of the global anti-war movement and contribute to the cause of peace.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide Economic Incentives for Peace Advocates:</strong> PCE is not just a symbol of anti-war efforts; it is a robust economic platform. With the USDT staking and PEPE mining pool rewards mechanism, advocates can participate in the global peace movement while earning tangible economic rewards, turning the cause of peace into an actionable economic force.</li>
        <li><strong>Build a Sustainable Community Economy:</strong> Through smart contracts, mining pool rewards, and token appreciation mechanisms, PCE will ensure stable and long-term growth. A decentralized rewards system will help maintain the tokenâ€™s value and ensure the sustainability of the global anti-war movement.</li>
      </ul>
