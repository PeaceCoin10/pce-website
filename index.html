      <h2>About PCE</h2>
      <p>In todayâ€™s global political and economic environment, wars and conflicts have profoundly impacted the lives of countless civilians. Despite rapid technological advancements and swift information dissemination, the destructive power of war remains deeply entrenched, affecting millions worldwide. From innocent lives lost to extensive economic damage, war not only destroys cities and infrastructure but also tears apart social fabric, impacting millions of families.</p>
      <p>The call for peace has grown louder, particularly among the younger generation, who not only demand peace but want to take tangible actions to achieve this goal. PCE (Peace Coin) emerged to meet this demand. As a cryptocurrency project focused on the global anti-war movement, PCE aims to leverage blockchain technology and the characteristics of cryptocurrency to enable every individual who wants to promote peace to participate in anti-war efforts and spread the global message of peace.</p>
      <p>The creation of PCE token is driven by the desire to use the decentralized nature of blockchain technology to provide an economic platform for global anti-war advocates, allowing them not only to contribute to the cause of global peace but also to gain tangible economic returns from their participation.</p>
      <p>The issuance of PCE is not merely about creating another cryptocurrency; it is about providing a new catalyst for the global anti-war movement by breaking through traditional financial constraints and advancing anti-war actions.</p>
